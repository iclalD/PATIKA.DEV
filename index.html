<h2>About Me</h2>
<!-- first title, About Me -->
<p>Hi there! I'm Iclal. I am 22 years old and I like to listen all kinds of music, play piano and ride horse. <br> I really like Hakan teacher's teaching method but I have a complain. It would be amazing if the video and writing content was a bit similar. Thanks teacher :]</p>
<!-- explained myself with a few features of mine and add a quote to the teacher -->

<!-- second title is about IT -->
<h3>My IT history</h3>

<p>Actually, there is not much of a history. It has been only 4 months and I have learned Java(Beginner Level) and I have the certificate, happily.</p>
<p> Now I am trying to learn Django. And this is the path I am walking. Enjoying every second.</p>
